Introduction:
Content-based filtering of emotions is a personalized recommendation approach that leverages the emotional content of items to make <br>
recommendations to users. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on user-item interactions, content-based filtering focuses on the<br>
intrinsic features of items and users' emotional preferences. By analyzing the emotional tone, sentiment, and context of content, this<br>
method tailors recommendations to match users' emotional states and preferences. It involves techniques such as sentiment analysis, natural<br>
language processing, and emotional profiling to understand the emotional resonance of content. Content-based filtering of emotions aims to<br>
enhance user satisfaction and engagement by delivering emotionally relevant recommendations tailored to individual preferences.
