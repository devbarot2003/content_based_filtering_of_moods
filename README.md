<h1><b>This is a Data Science NLP project.</b></h1><br>
<br>
<b>Introduction:</b>
<br><br>
Content-based filtering of emotions is a personalized recommendation approach that leverages the emotional content of items to make recommendations to users. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on user-item interactions, content-based filtering focuses on the intrinsic features of items and users' emotional preferences. By analyzing the emotional tone, sentiment, and context of content, this method tailors recommendations to match users' emotional states and preferences. It involves techniques such as sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and emotional profiling to understand the emotional resonance of content. Content-based filtering of emotions aims to enhance user satisfaction and engagement by delivering emotionally relevant recommendations tailored to individual preferences.
